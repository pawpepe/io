		<div class="hobbie">
			<h3> I love being outdoors and traveling. I am always down for a hike, bike ride, camping or all together at once! I also love learning new technologies and doing some projects on my free time. If you are hungry let me know because I have some experience in the kitchen! Since our memory is not perfect I end up recording them by taking a good amount of pictures(All the photos used on my website/ blogs/ social media were taken by me).  </h3>

			<h3>I love horses, I used to compete in horse jumping championships when I was a teenager. I also have lots of fun learning a new language because it puts you out of your comfort zone and teaches you a lot about another culture. One of my favorites quotes is “I know that I know nothing”-  such an interesting paradox...</h3> </div>
