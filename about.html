		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
		<div class="hobbie">
			<h3> I love being outdoors. I am always down for a hike, bike ride, camping or all togheter at once! I also love leaning new technologies and doing some projects on my free time. Like figuring out what ports on the protoboards control the motor on the robot and program an arduino to control those motors. </h3>

			<h3>I love horses, I used to compete in horse jumping when I was a teenager. I also have lots of fun learning a new language because it puts you out of your confort zone and teach you a lot about another culture. Learning a new language and culture also shows how similar we all are as well. </h3> </div>
